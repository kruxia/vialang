## test boolean comparisons
## * Combine boolean and / or / not with all kinds of comparisons.
## * We only use a, b, c as scalars here; "scalar.yaml" tests a variety of scalars.
## * These examples are being tortured for a good cause. No actual examples are being
##   harmed in these experiments

- via: >- 
    both a less than b 
    and c greater than d
  results:

- via: >-
    either a not greater than b 
    or c less than or equal to d
  results:

- via: not a less than b
  results:

- via: not a not greater than or equal to b
  results:

- via: >- 
    both a less than b 
    and not c greater than or equal to d
  results:

- via: >-
    either not a less than b 
    or c not less than or equal to d
  results:

# nested booleans with comparisons
- via: >-
    both a not equal to or greater than b 
    and 
      either c equal to or greater than d 
      or not e greater than f
  results:

# comparison with nested booleans
- via: >- 
    either not a or not b 
    equal to 
    both 
      either a or not b 
      and c
